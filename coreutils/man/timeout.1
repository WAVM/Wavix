.SH NAME
timeout \- run a command with a time limit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timeout
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR] \fI\,DURATION COMMAND \/\fR[\fI\,ARG\/\fR]...
.br
.B timeout
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.HP
\fB\-\-preserve\-status\fR
.IP
exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the
.IP
command times out
.HP
\fB\-\-foreground\fR
.IP
when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,
.IP
allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals;
in this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-kill\-after\fR=\fI\,DURATION\/\fR
.IP
also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running
.IP
this long after the initial signal was sent
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fI\,SIGNAL\/\fR
.IP
specify the signal to be sent on timeout;
.IP
SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number;
see 'kill \fB\-l\fR' for a list of signals
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
diagnose to stderr any signal sent upon timeout
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix:
\&'s' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.
.PP
If the command times out, and \fB\-\-preserve\-status\fR is not set, then exit with
status 124.  Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND.  If no signal
is specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills
any process that does not block or catch that signal.  It may be necessary
to use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught, in which
case the exit status is 128+9 rather than 124.
.SH BUGS
Some platforms don't currently support timeouts beyond the year 2038.
