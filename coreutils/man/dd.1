.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the operands.
.TP
bs=BYTES
read and write up to BYTES bytes at a time (default: 512);
overrides ibs and obs
.TP
cbs=BYTES
convert BYTES bytes at a time
.TP
conv=CONVS
convert the file as per the comma separated symbol list
.TP
count=N
copy only N input blocks
.TP
ibs=BYTES
read up to BYTES bytes at a time (default: 512)
.TP
if=FILE
read from FILE instead of stdin
.TP
iflag=FLAGS
read as per the comma separated symbol list
.TP
obs=BYTES
write BYTES bytes at a time (default: 512)
.TP
of=FILE
write to FILE instead of stdout
.TP
oflag=FLAGS
write as per the comma separated symbol list
.TP
seek=N
skip N obs\-sized blocks at start of output
.TP
skip=N
skip N ibs\-sized blocks at start of input
.TP
status=LEVEL
The LEVEL of information to print to stderr;
\&'none' suppresses everything but error messages,
\&'noxfer' suppresses the final transfer statistics,
\&'progress' shows periodic transfer statistics
.PP
N and BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
c =1, w =2, b =512, kB =1000, K =1024, MB =1000*1000, M =1024*1024, xM =M,
GB =1000*1000*1000, G =1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
.PP
Each CONV symbol may be:
.TP
ascii
from EBCDIC to ASCII
.TP
ebcdic
from ASCII to EBCDIC
.TP
ibm
from ASCII to alternate EBCDIC
.TP
block
pad newline\-terminated records with spaces to cbs\-size
.TP
unblock
replace trailing spaces in cbs\-size records with newline
.TP
lcase
change upper case to lower case
.TP
ucase
change lower case to upper case
.TP
sparse
try to seek rather than write the output for NUL input blocks
.TP
swab
swap every pair of input bytes
.TP
sync
pad every input block with NULs to ibs\-size; when used
with block or unblock, pad with spaces rather than NULs
.TP
excl
fail if the output file already exists
.TP
nocreat
do not create the output file
.TP
notrunc
do not truncate the output file
.TP
noerror
continue after read errors
.TP
fdatasync
physically write output file data before finishing
.TP
fsync
likewise, but also write metadata
.PP
Each FLAG symbol may be:
.TP
append
append mode (makes sense only for output; conv=notrunc suggested)
.TP
direct
use direct I/O for data
.TP
directory
fail unless a directory
.TP
dsync
use synchronized I/O for data
.TP
sync
likewise, but also for metadata
.TP
fullblock
accumulate full blocks of input (iflag only)
.TP
nonblock
use non\-blocking I/O
.TP
noatime
do not update access time
.TP
nocache
Request to drop cache.  See also oflag=sync
.TP
noctty
do not assign controlling terminal from file
.TP
nofollow
do not follow symlinks
.TP
count_bytes
treat 'count=N' as a byte count (iflag only)
.TP
skip_bytes
treat 'skip=N' as a byte count (iflag only)
.TP
seek_bytes
treat 'seek=N' as a byte count (oflag only)
.PP
Sending a USR1 signal to a running 'dd' process makes it
print I/O statistics to standard error and then resume copying.
.PP
Options are:
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
