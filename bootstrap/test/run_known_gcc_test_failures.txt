# Expected failures from running the assembled GCC torture tests.

# Syntax: Each line has a single test to be marked as a 'known failure' (or
# 'exclusion'. Known failures are expected to fail, and will cause an error if
# they pass. (Known failures that do not run at all will not cause an
# error). The format is
# <name> <attributes> # comment
# where <name> matches the file name (no directory) passed to the test runner,
# and <attributes> is a comma-separated list of filter attributes. Each run of
# the test runner is said to have " a set of "attributes" that represent the
# configuration: e.g. which compiler, optimization level, JS engine etc is used
# for that run. A test will be excluded if the configuration has all of the
# attributes in the exclusion line. For example if a configuration has
# ['asm2wasm', 'O2', 'd8'] then the exclusion will apply if it has the
# attributes 'asm2wasm' or 'O2,d8' or no attributes, but not if it has 'bare' or
# 'asm2wasm,d8'. A test can be listed multiple times with different attribute
# sets, but not with the same (or a subset).

#
# Files with a .o.wasm extension are built using clang and lld native backends.
#
# Near-term TODO: Add different optimization levels, with their own attributes.
# A possible TODO: Allow wildcard matching to combine the corresponding bare and
# emscripten entry into a single line. This may not be worth it, as there isn't
# a huge amount of overlap.
