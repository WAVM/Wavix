	// A lightly encapsulated hash table, used internally by HashMap and HashSet.
	//
	//   It has a concept of both elements and keys: the key is something derivable from an element
	// that is used to find an element in the table. For a set, Key=Element, but for a map,
	// Key!=Element, and HashTablePolicy::getKey(Element) is used to derive the key of an element in
	// the hash table.
	//
	//   The implementation is a Robin Hood hash table.
	//
	//   The buckets are a linear array of elements paired with pointer-sized metadata that uses 1
	// bit to indicate whether the bucket is occupied, and the rest of the bits to store the hash of
	// the occupying element. The array is indexed by a hash of the element's key, modulo the number
	// of buckets, which is always a power of two.
	//
	//   Storing the hash and occupancy of a bucket imposes some overhead on the simplest cases
	// where the key is small/easy to hash and has a null value, but avoids pathological performance
	// in the general case. It also makes it easier to write good debugger visualizers for the hash
	// tables.
	//
	//   If more than one element hashes to the same bucket, the extra elements will be stored in
	// the buckets following the "ideal bucket" in the table. There is an abstract concept of how
	// "rich" an element is by how close it is stored to its ideal bucket.
	//   When inserting new elements, they are stored in the leftmost bucket, starting from their
	// ideal bucket, that is empty or holds an element that hashes to a higher bucket than their
	// ideal bucket. If the bucket contains an element, that element, and the elements from any
	// subsequent consecutively occupied buckets are moved one bucket right to make space for it.
	//   When removing an element, the chain of elements in following buckets are shifted left into
	// the hole until an empty bucket is found, or an element that is in its ideal bucket.
	//   This insert/remove strategy maintains the invariant that all elements that hash to the same
	// ideal bucket are stored in consecutive buckets at or following the ideal bucket, and elements
	// that hash to different buckets are sorted w.r.t. their ideal bucket. This invariant allows
	// searches to stop once they reach an element whose ideal bucket is to the right of the search
	// key's ideal bucket, limiting the worst case search time.
	//
	//   This is more complex than an externally chained hash table, which stored a list of elements
	// in each hash bucket, but has far better cache coherency as searching for a key is a linear
	// walk through memory, and less allocator overhead as the entire table uses a single
	// allocation.
	//
	//   For the table to function correctly, it must contain at least one empty bucket. As the
	// table approaches 100% occupancy, the collision rate increases, and the worst case search time
	// increases quickly.
	//   The table is dynamically resized as dictated by the AllocPolicy. The default
	// policy keeps the table between 35% and 80% occupied. This gives an average occupancy of 65%,
	// or about 2x space usage compared to just storing an array of the elements.
